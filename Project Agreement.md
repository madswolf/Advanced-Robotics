# Project Agreement

## Problem

This research project will examine the possibilities of morphing an underwater robot, in order to alter its bouyancy, and therefore manipulate its height when submerged in layered immiscible liquids (such as vegetable oil on top of water). This robot should, ideally, be able to report its height in the liquid, while remaining completely waterproof and wireless.

The project will include researching bouyancy and how to manipulate an objects' bouyancy, as well as exploring different design ideas and languages of the robot while noting their respective pros and cons for further evaluation and comparison.

The research project is intended as a start to researching underwater morphing robots, which will be further developed on later, such as in our Master's thesis.

## Method

The research project will start with a research phase, where the physics of bouyancy, as well as other relevant factors will be explored. This is done to achieve sufficient knowledge within the subject, as to allow for designing efficient solutions.

After the research phase, different designs mockups will be constructed, ideally exploring different physical properties, based on the earlier research.

The different designs will be evaulated on different criteria, such as but not limited to:

<li>Cost</li>
<li>Ease of use</li>
<li>Size of solution/Simplicity</li>
<li>Precision</li>

## Handin

A written report, explaining the methods, conclusions and other relevant finds within the subject, as well as any design mockups/sketches or otherwise made along the way.
