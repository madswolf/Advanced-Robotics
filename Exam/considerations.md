When doing learning with multiple avoiders there is a consideration if all avoiders should learn, if they all do they will become good at avoiding the emergent stategies of the other avoiders and seeker, but another avoider made by one of the other teams might have learnt to behave in a completely different way than the ones we evolved causing our learning to be less effective.


If we use qlearning with it's q table that has states and actions then we will have one state for things like avoider ahead or seeker ahead, but only one at a time. So should we have priority for this? if we can see the safezone and the seeker then we might lose the possibility of rushing it the safe zone if we prioritize the threat of the seeker over the safety of the safe zone.
